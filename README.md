# ℹ️ About me

Hi! My name is Calvin, a dedicated blockchain validator.

I want you to consider me as a potential validator for your project because I found it very interesting and promising

My experience is more than two years, I have a technical background and I can call myself a qualified professional in the field of node operation

To keep track of my servers I use services like zabbix, grphana and prometheus which allows me to always keep an eye on the nodes and fix any problems on time.

If a node fails I get a notification and I always have access to solve the problem and I will definitely inform the team what happened if the problem is not on my side.
